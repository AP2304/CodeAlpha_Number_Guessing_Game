# Number_Guessing_Game
I developed Simple Number Guessing Game using C++

## Problem Statement

This program implements a simple Number Guessing Game where the computer randomly selects a secret number between 1 and 100, and the player attempts to guess the number. After each guess, the program provides feedback, telling the player whether their guess was too high, too low, or correct. The goal is to guess the secret number in as few attempts as possible.

The game allows the player to play multiple rounds, where after each round, the player is prompted whether they want to play again.

### Features

- The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100.
- The player inputs a guess, and the program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- The number of attempts is tracked and displayed when the player guesses the number correctly.
- The player can choose to play multiple rounds by answering 'y' or 'Y' when asked if they want to play again.

### Input

- The player guesses a number between 1 and 100.
- After each round, the player is asked whether they want to play again (input 'y' or 'Y' for yes, any other input for no).

### Output

- After each guess, the program will inform the player if their guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- If the player guesses correctly, the program will congratulate them and display the number of attempts it took to guess the number.
- If the player chooses not to play again, the program will thank them for playing.
